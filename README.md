# 🦠 Malaria Cell Image Classifier

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow to detect malaria-infected red blood cells from microscopic images.

## 🔬 Dataset

- Source: NIH Malaria Cell Image Dataset
- [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria)
- The dataset contains 27,000+ images classified as either `Parasitized` or `Uninfected`.

## 🧠 Model Overview

- Built with TensorFlow & Keras
- Custom CNN architecture
- Includes image preprocessing, augmentation, and hyperparameter tuning
- Achieved high validation accuracy (>90%)

## 📊 Evaluation

- Accuracy & loss plotted over training epochs
- Validation strategy used to prevent overfitting

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

## 📁 File

- `malaria_cnn_model.ipynb`: Full notebook with code, training, and results

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Add confusion matrix and classification report
- Deploy using Streamlit as a web app
- Package for command-line usage
