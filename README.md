## 🧠 Model Overview

The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras to classify parasitized vs uninfected cells. It also includes hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Performance

Achieved high validation accuracy with careful data preprocessing and model tuning.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add confusion matrix and evaluation metrics
- Deploy with Streamlit for demo
